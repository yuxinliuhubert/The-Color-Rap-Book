\f0\fs24 \cf0 	Ann Harris Smith graduated from Saint Joseph College, a four-year liberal arts college for women in Emmitsburg, Maryland. It was during these years in college that she happened to attend a co-ed dance at nearby Mount Saint Mary\'92s University, where she a student, her charming, husband-to-be, Mike. It was love at first sight! The family eventually made their home in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, with their two children, Molly and Matt. Over the thirty heartwarming years of teaching kindergarten, the cups full of love and tablespoons of sunny laughs were just a few of the ingredients in an extraordinary recipe she created especially for her students of the lasting joy of reading and the gratification that comes with it. Ann is always remembered as a happy, vibrant, loving wife, mother, sister, and friend who made every person she would meet feel like they were family. Her colorful and rhythmic curriculum continues to be an integral part of elementary classrooms by using the The Color Rap Book.\\n	The Ann Harris Smith Foundation for Gynecological Cancers was created in her name to support women and their families in the region who are suffering from gynecological cancers and also to educate the community of the signs and symptoms of these diseases. Shortly after her retirement, Ann began experiencing symptoms of what doctors eventually diagnosed as stage 3C ovarian cancer. It had spread throughout her body. Fighter that she was, Ann underwent major surgery and many rounds of chemotherapy however in July 2002 at the young age of 53, she passed away. Early on her symptoms had been disregarded as signs of aging. She never wanted other women to have to go through what she did. Being an educator, she believed that making sure every women had the resources and knowledge to understand better the signs and symptoms, she, with her family, created the Ann Harris Smith Foundation. They held the inaugural Laurel Auto Group Pro-Am Charity Golf Tournament in July of 2000. This continues to this day serve as the sole fundraiser for the foundation.\\n	It was In 2014, the Smith family established a second branch of the foundation with a mission to support early childhood education. Ann\'92s influence remains with the hundreds of students she cared for throughout her teaching career. The Color Rap Book will enable Ann\'92s legacy to continue by reaching as many classrooms as possible, supporting learning for the very young, and facilitating The Color Rap Reading Program.\\n \\n

	Ann was an avid runner and combined her love of teaching and running to create the color raps. Wanting to come up with a fun way to introduce colors to the children, the rhythm of her feet hitting the ground provided the beat \'85red, red, red spelled R-E-D\'85As she introduced the color the children were also enveloped with her love of cooking. Goodies like blueberry pancakes, spaghetti sauce and sweet potato muffins were cooked and devoured. Learning was fun and delicious!\\n \\n

	The Smith family is very grateful for all the support of friends, family, sponsors, and volunteers since our beginning in 2000. Together we are making a difference!\\n	While we continue to passionately work towards our cancer education and awareness mission, expanding our initiative to support early childhood development needs for children in our community is off to a great start. With the newest publication of The Color Rap Book and the distribution to kindergarten classes, we are helping young children begin their educational journey.\\n	Ann\'92s daughter Molly shared one of her special memories about her mother as a teacher: "My Mom always was able to relate to young children and they gravitated towards her... it was an amazing thing to watch. She spent many years of her teaching life with Kindergarten children. She would always say that they came into her classroom as babies at the beginning of the year, but by the end, they were little people learning to read and soaking up so much knowledge like little sponges!"\\n \\n

	The first edition of The Color Rap Book was presented as a Christmas gift in 2013 to Lauren Miller, a dear friend and teaching colleague of Ann, from her daughters, Amber and Ashley. Using materials similar to what Ann would have used in her classroom, they used tissue paper, construction paper and colored foils. Amber and Ashley compiled Ann\'92s raps and designed and printed the The Color Rap Book using a popular online photo service. In addition to presenting a copy to their mother, they also presented a copy to the Smith family. The Smith family was so impressed, they asked them to order more. In 2014, they found a print shop and ordered 500 copies. The copies were distributed to donors of the Ann Harris Smith Foundation and to a few local kindergarten teachers. The Smiths have been planning on the book\'92s second edition for several years. The first edition was well done however the foundation saw the potential to turn this gift \'96 originally intended to treasure on a personal level \'96 into one that could be given to incoming kindergarteners at local school districts for years to come.\\n	The second edition was printed in July 2019. The Smith family consider The Color Rap Book to be a wonderful opportunity to share Ann\'92s legacy, to inspire a new generation of teachers, and to continue to make learning fun. We believe she would be so happy and proud that so many people put in so much time and energy to put this all together and to care enough to try to get this into so many classrooms. The addition of this amazing app by our friend, Yuxin Liu, for the Ann Harris Smith Foundation has furthered our ability to reach families and support our mission of early childhood education.\\n \\n

\f4 \cf0 	Welcome and thank you for clicking on my page! I have been waiting to tell you this for a while. How was the book experience, and did you like this new way of exploring The Color Rap Book?\\n \\n	My name is Yuxin Liu, or Hubert. I am an international student in the graduating class of 2020 from Bishop McCort Catholic High School in Johnstown, PA. Now I am heading to University of California Berkeley to continue my education as a mechanical engineer whose dream is to have his own aerospace company that does intercontinental or even interplanetary transportation.\\n	Some of the fun stuff I do to kill time: playing the piano, guitar, ukulele, doing sports (really anything; jack of all trades but master of none), reading, playing games, and hanging out with my friends. \\n	I live with a local American family, which has given me tremendous support and love besides my biological parents in China. They are John and Julie\'97often claiming that they only love me \'93sometimes.\'94

\f4 \cf0 (Small secret: if you haven\'92t noticed yet,I set the clapping for myself the longest\'97the power of being the \'93code monkey.\'94)\\n \\n	So how did I get into the creation of this app? Well, I have always been passionate about coding (Asian, coding, big surprise huh 
\f2 \uc0\u55357 \u56834 
\f4 ), and have created from calculator programs to an actual cell phone app for McCort for sending school announcement reminders to students. Because of my experience (even though limited), Mr. Matt Smith and the current principle of McCort, Mr. Tom Smith, gave me this valuable opportunity to demonstrate my coding ability and to contribute to the community. Spending over 500+ hours on this projects, I designed all the animations and functions from the ground up with great help from Jennie, and advice from my parents, my host family, and many of my friends who offered to be the program testers. Again, I could not thank them enough for their efforts! \\n	There are times when I would get stuck, and would spend 16-17 hours digging at a problem, forgetting to eat or sleep, and being extremely upset and wanting to quit; however, when the magic moment hit with a success like Thomas Edison\'92s discovery of the correct lightbulb filament material, I am more motivated to continue working the project than ever. \\n \\n	Me and my friends camping near Cape May, NJ. It was during this trip that one of the my app-making tools, a graphing calculator, got flooded in one of the storms.
